  - heading: Welcome
    text: "Your task is to create a game described by the list of requirements. We
      would like this delivered 2 to 4 days from when you start on it but if you
      need more time let us know. The requirements are the minimum needed for the
      project so anything extra you want to add is fine but don\u2019t feel you need
      to. The goal of this test is to write clean reusable code and to show your
      knowledge of Unity. It is less focused on polish and looking nice but having
      a polished good looking project is always a plus."
